# Spotifube

A `GUI` for the [`spotify-downloader`](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/) project.

## Purpose

Spotifube will initially provide (MVP) a simple GUI for [`spotify-downloader`](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/) that allows users to drag and drop playlist links, to fetch the tracks inside of these playlists and to download these songs into a folder.

### What is spotify-downloader

[`spotify-downloader`](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/) is a command-line tool that matches Spotify tracks/playlists to Youtube videos and downloads them as mp3/m4a, with id3, album art, etc.

## Contributing
